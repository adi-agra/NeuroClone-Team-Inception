Here’s a guide on how to start working with our project.

DL Assignments : 
In order to apply concepts of deep learning and start work on EEG signal processing , it is important to complete the assignments from … whose solutions are enclosed. 

EEG : Here are some resources compiled in one place to start with zero understanding upto near to advanced level of understanding about EEG signals and BCI ( Brain Computer Interface)  
 

ROS GAZEBO :  It is very important to get familiar with the complete ros interface. For this complete the beginner and preferably intermediate level tutorials of ROS from the official website. Preferred version for Ubuntu ( on VMWare Workstation or VirtualBox ) is 16.04 
Robot_control_class : This has a class with a complete list to manipulate the Turtlebot. Modify this according to your robot.

Add_two_ints.txt : sample server client to add two integers 
The other files are tests for using basic python loops with the turtlebot to start creating your final code to run your robot. 


Solidworks : 
This is to start working on making your own model. Get the basic understanding of SOLIDWORKS interface and try to replicate the models which will test your understanding of what you have learnt. 


Great! Now you are good to go to make your clone Neuro Clone!
